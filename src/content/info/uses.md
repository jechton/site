A non-exhaustive list of things I use!

## Hardware

- Sony WH-1000XM6 headphones
  - These are very comfortable and have the best noise cancelling I've found so far.
- 8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller
- Logitech M185 Wireless Mouse
  - Not the most comfortable mouse, but definitely one of the most affordable for what you get.
- Logitech Ergo K860 Wireless Keyboard

## Software

- [CachyOS](https://cachyos.org/) is my distro of choice currently. I've also used:
  - [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com)
  - [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org)
  - [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com) and [Debian](https://debian.com) on some servers.
  - [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). If I can put something into a container, I will.
- I flop between [Zed](https://zed.dev/) and [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for my code editor.
- [fish](https://fishshell.com) as my shell.
- I put Gruvbox theming on everything that I can.
